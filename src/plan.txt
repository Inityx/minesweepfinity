hashmap<u64,usize> holding pointers to board chunks
u64 is concat of i32 x-coord, i32 y-coord 
chunk is static array (16x16)

chunk information:
	mines (binary)
	clicked (binary)
	neighboring mines (0-9)

mines and clicked can each get an array of u16

0000 0000 = 0
0000 1001 = 9
u64 = u16*4, 0-9 is 4 bits
one u64 can store neighbor information for a 16-length row
